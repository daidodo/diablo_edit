# How to Contribute

Thank you for helping improve the project!

## Introduction

The software is developed in MFC on **Microsoft Visual Studio 2017**.

There are 2 projects in *暗黑II.sln*:

* Diablo Edit2: Main project for the editor.
* Generate Data: Helper poject to generate language and game data for the editor.

## Language Support

The editor supports 3 languages: English, Traditional and Simplified Chinese.

All language data are in *Diablo Edit2\language.dat* which is generated from *Generate Data\language.txt*.

### Add Translations

Currently, Traditional and Simplified Chinese translations are incomplete. If you want to add translations, here are the steps:

* Open *Generate Data\language.txt* via **Microsoft Excel**.
  * `*LANG`: File tag. DO NOT MODIFY!
  * First column: String index. If empty, it'll start from 0 and increase automatically.
  * Remaining columns: Translations of all languages.
  * Other lines starting with `*`: Section headers. A section is a group of translations, e.g. all skill names.
